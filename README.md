# Overlay Experiments
Trying to figure out how to build an \<div> based overlay and pass events through it to the underlaying content. You will will need a TypeScript compiler to make this work. <br/>
This is a local only project. Does not get deployed to any server. Also does not work with Chrome at this point, because XMLHttpRequest() does not work against local files. On Windows, using Edge works just fine.

# Usage
1. Clone
2. Run tsc in the directory
3. Open *index.html* in the your browser (Edge)
